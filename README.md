About
=====

The GridBee Web Computing Framework is a JavaScript library that enables modern browsers (currently Chrome and Firefox) to participate in distributed computing projects and act as web based clients. The framework features BOINC specific classes that enable the client to act as a full feature BOINC web client requesting and executing JavaScript workunits.

You can find out more about GridBee if you visit our official homepage at http://webcomputing.iit.bme.hu where you can also check out our client in action.

The graphical web client based on the GridBee framework can be found at https://github.com/molnarg/gridbee-client/
